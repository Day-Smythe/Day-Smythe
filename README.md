## 📈 Current Hyper Fixation 

Building a 'static' webpage that will act as a wiki style information site for peoples original anthropomorphic characters.

It will feature a filter system to show only a certain kind as well as a local reverse image search that will se if a given fursona is in the wiki, if they are it will return all of the known information about that fursona.

Being on the site is completely up to the fursonas owner, and you can remove your fursona at any point, which will delete all records of it from the site. There is not and will never be an undo button for this. 

All records are stored in a GitHub repository, as well as all of the images and data. If at any point you feel unsafe having your data on the site and for some reason you can't delete it yourself, then message me directly via email.
